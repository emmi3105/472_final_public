# 472_final_public
This repository contains the data science project that is part of the final assignment for the class "MY472 - Data for Data Scientists".

We use data from the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), the [LastFM API](https://www.last.fm/de/api) and the [Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-certified_music_artists_in_the_United_States) to investigate to what extent the 100 greatest music artist of all time as ranked by the [Rolling Stone Magazine](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/) in 2010 have endured in 2023. Furthermore, we analyse which factors might contribute to endurance by analysing correlation between endurance and album release dates, being on tour, and RIAA certification units.

We find that most artists ranked by the Rolling Stone Magazine trail behind the most popular artists of 2023. Nonetheless, there are a few artists that remain very popular today. Additionally, we find that recent album releases as well as being on tour positively correlate with endurance.

We suggest further analysis of the correlations we found in order to find causal relationships.
